Install\n\nInstall with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):\n\n```sh\n$ npm install --save ansi-colors\n```\n\n## Why was this module created?\n\nThis module was created to make it easy to allow color configuration through options. This module inlines the code from [these other ansi-* modules](#related-projects) for faster load times. The lazy loading of the [underlying modules](#related-projects) modules has been moved to [ansi-colors-lazy](https://github.com/doowb/ansi-colors-lazy).\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nvar colors = require('ansi-colors');\n```\n\n## About\n\n### Related projects\n\n* [ansi-bgblack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ansi-bgblack): The color bgblack, in ansi. |
